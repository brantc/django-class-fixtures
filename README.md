# django-class-fixtures

The purpose of django-class-fixtures is to augment Django's fixture system. It
allows you to create fixtures as Python code instead of serialized JSON,
XML or YAML files, with all the flexibility that allows.

Requirements:

* Python 2.6+ (Python 3 is not yet supported)
* Django 1.3+

Comprehensive documentation with examples and tutorials can be found under
[docs/](docs/) in reStructuredText format, but the most comfortable way to read it
is to visit [Read the Docs](http://readthedocs.org/docs/django-class-fixtures/en/latest/).
